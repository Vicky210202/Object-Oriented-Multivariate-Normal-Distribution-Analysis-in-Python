Multivariate Normal Distribution analysis with OOP concept in Python


# Abstract
The multivariate normal distribution is a statistical concept that extends beyond the typical bell-shaped curve, encompassing scenarios where multiple related random variables are involved. While popular Python packages like Statsmodels, Scipy and Pyro handle multivariate normal problems, they lack specific functions for tasks such as finding conditional and marginal distributions, checking independence, calculating correlation coefficients, handling unequal covariance matrices in two-sample problems, conducting multivariate analysis of variance and comparing population means using Wilkâ€™s lambda. To address these gaps, the proposed MultiVariateNormal package aims to provide explicit functions for these tasks. This will make it easier for users to work with and analyze multivariate normal distributions in a more comprehensive manner.
